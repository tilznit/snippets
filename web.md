### Is the site content static?
Problem with static conect is: It's static. There is nothing to exploit. So the only thing you could try doing is attacking the actual server implementation (like apache) or any used forward proxy. Both of these attacks imo. rarely work unless the server is stupidly out of date or there comes a new zero day.
